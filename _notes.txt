=== DOCUMENTATION LOGGING ===

= OBJECTS =
create_object (name, col)
    Creates an empty object with name 'name' and puts it in the collection 'col'.
    - 'name' requires a string.
    - 'col' can be a string or a collection reference.
    - If col does not exist, it will be created.

= COLLECTIONS = 
create_collection (name)
    Creates a collection with name 'name' and links it to the active scene.
    - 'name' requires a string.
    - If the collection already exists, it will return False.
collection_exists (name)
    Checks to see if a collection exists.
    - 'name' requires a string.
    - Returns a True or False value depending on the result of the check.
delete_collection (name, delete_objects)
    Deletes the collection and all of the child objects (by default). Whether child objects will be deleted can be overrided by setting the delete_objects value to False.
    - 'name' can be both a string and a collection reference.
